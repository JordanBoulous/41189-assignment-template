    "This report will be focused on investigating the Covid-19 pandemic, government lockdown measures and society’s subsequent response. Covid-19 is an extremely infectious disease, transmitted through droplets of coughs, sneezes or exhales generated by an exposed person. Since the discovery of the new strain of Coronavirus, it has infected over 31.4 million people worldwide and taken the lives of over 966 thousand people. Australia has over 27 thousand confirmed cases with 850 fatalities (ABS, 2020). Although Australia has seen somewhat subsided Coronavirus cases in comparison to the world, government intervention has been swift and stringent. March 23rd, a landmark date for unprecedented government intervention with the Morrison administration announcing a ban on all non-essential services (M. Grattan, 2020) Society was brought to a halt, businesses were forced to shut and citizens were encouraged to adhere to stay-at-home orders (M. Grattan, 2020). Businesses that were deemed ‘essential’ also bore the brunt of the virus as most citizens were too scared to venture outside their homes. As businesses suspended trading many found themselves without a job, the unemployment rate rising to 6.8%, compared to 5.3% last year (ABS, 2020). With so many of the population out of work, there has also been a reduction in consumer spending, reduced by 20 per cent compared to the pre-pandemic norm (ABS, 2020). \n",
    "\n",
    "During the introduction of the government’s lockdown measures, citizens were mostly obedient, following stay-at-home orders which kept Coronavirus daily cases below 100 (ABS, 2020). However, Victorians have been subject to longer, more stringent lockdown measures as a result of a spike in Coronavirus cases. As seen on the 30th of July, Victoria recorded 723 new cases, the largest spike in Australia (ABS, 2020). Victorians have been subject to 2 months of Stage 4 Lockdown. have started to question the government’s lockdown measures (VIC GOV, 2020). Residents are citing the economic damage and the seeming eternal extensions of lockdown measures as reasons for their protests and riots (M. Paul, E. Clure, 2020). Over 300 Victorians have been caught protesting on September 5th, in a bid to end their Stage 4 lockdown (M. Paul, E. Clure, 2020). It is evident a small portion of society is dissatisfied with government intervention in regards to Covid 19, with residents complaining about the length and the strict enforcement of lockdown measures. \n",
    "Finally, this report aims to outline the eventual distribution of vaccines. A Covid-19 vaccine is hoped to prevent the virus from infecting the immune system. Vaccines are rumoured to be available to Australians within the next year, with the Morrison government securing over 84 million doses (S. Morrison, 2020). However, a study by Iposos surveyed over 20,000 adults to test their willingness to take a vaccine. In Australia, it was found that 1 in 10 adults would choose not to get vaccinated and only a 59% acceptance rate worldwide (Iposos, 2020). Iposos cites fear of side effects (56%) and doubt of effectiveness (29%) as reasons for declining the vaccine. \n",

However, it was also found in stool samples, the gastrointestinal tract, saliva and urine. It also states that the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) virion is spherical with a diameter of 80-120nm, contains a non-segmented, positive-sense RNA genome and contains numerous glycoproteins. Diagnosis and testing involves a swab and is often performed when a patient experiences fever, a sore throat, dry cough, dyspnea or they were in contact with a recent confirmed case.\n",

It lists the same symptoms as the article (fever, cough, shortness of breath, sore throat) as well as uncommon symptoms. If an individual experiences any of these symptoms, they are advised to get tested and contact the ‘Coronavirus Helpline’ which provides 24/7 support. It is important to isolate after getting tested. The demographics most at risk according to the page are travellers who have recently been overseas, those who have been in contact with someone with COVID-19, people in correctional facilities and people in group residential settings. If an individual has been overseas, they must isolate for 14 days and testing is important. Those most at risk of serious illness include older people and people with compromised immune systems, disabilities or chronic conditions.

    "Models are a way to simulate a population’s behavior. By understanding models, they can be used to assist with predictions, designs and actions (UML, 2013). Government leaders all over the world are utilizing hundreds of models in an effort to understand and inhibit the transmission of the Coronavirus (ABC, 2020). Although the specific relationship between Covid cases, riots and lockdown measures have not yet been thoroughly investigated, both government agencies and private businesses have made extensive records of Covid 19 cases. Currently, the Australian Government is using Compartmental SEIR models led by the Doherty Institute as a basis for important decisions (J. Janson, 2020). The Compartmental SEIR model uses compartments as a means to simplify the mathematical modelling of infectious diseases. SEIR refers to the different states the population can exist in; susceptible, exposed, infectious and recovered. As the compartmental model is represented by an exponential decay, meaning there is an asymptote at zero infected individuals (J. Janson, 2020). \n",

    "In an effort to prohibit the transmission of the Coronavirus, governments all over the world have issued varying levels of lockdown and stay-home measures. However, by enforcing these orders and saving lives, private businesses are facing hardships as customers are scarce and money is tight. As stated by PWC’s report “We estimate that over a year , a coronavirus pandemic could reduce Australia’s GDP by $34.2 billion”. PWC have used the Global Trade Analysis model (GTAM) which is “a multi-region global, multisector, computable general equilibrium model”. A similar approach was adopted by the Commonwealth Treasury during the SARS outbreak of 2002-03. The GTAM is a mathematical model that uses a “back casting exercise”, which analyses data from previous years or instances in order to model its current task. The GTAM uses a plethora of data in an attempt to cover as many aspects of the economy as possible. \n",

    "Current SEIR models are significantly preventing COVID 19 from being fully addressed and solved. SEIR models currently are overly pessimistic, such that they depict the worse effects that COVID 19 can have on individuals (Sun, 2020). By expressing these worse case scenarios depicts an inaccurate depiction of COVID 19 as currently not everyone is facing the worse off effects with many of them experiencing small to mild effects. Another issue that occurs from SEIR models is exponential decay occurs within these models. This negatively portrays the actual number of COVID 19 cases suggesting that COVID cases will never reach 0 cases. In reality this is incorrect because once a vaccine is developed there will be no COVID 19 cases, which is uncorrelated to the SEIR models exponential decay function. \n",

Big Data Models have the main purpose of suggesting how many cases of COVID 19 per day or all together in a certain country or population. This doesn’t solve the issue of COVID 19 as it only shows the number of cases and does not depict ways in which the pandemic can be dealt with. Also Big Data Models also show an inaccurate number of COVID 19 cases as in many developing countries, several cases go unreported (Lau, 2020). This doesn’t provide a true addressment of the actual number of COVID 19 cases in these countries. This also has a strong negative effect on the analysis of this data as the data analysis will be inaccurate in terms of the characteristics of COVID 19 cases in different countries (Lau, 2020). \n",

    "Agent based models attempt to simulate the real world in a 1:1 ratio. This is done by simulating the actions and interactions of autonomous agents that can be individuals or collectives, while assessing and analysing their effects on the system as a whole. This behaviour is based on their relations with the other agents. \n",
    "Individual agents are characterised as a rational thinker, meaning that they behave as such to optimise their goals using heuristics. One way to interpret this is ecological rationality. This could involve an individual looking over a fence and copying their neighbour if they are doing a task better, or keep doing the same thing while occasionally trying something new. The basic idea is to imitate, exploit and explore. The decisions an individual makes propagates through a complex network of interactions and the surrounding environment.\n",

Schelling wanted a reason as to why people of different races and incomes tend to segregate in most parts of the developed world. It explains how an individual will segregate based on the behaviour of the surrounding agents or neighbours.\n",
    "Imagine a NxN checkerboard. Some people (represented by squares) receive a higher salary AP and the others have a lower salary BP where P represents an individual. If I belong to the former category AP and most of my neighbours also belong to AP and hence AP ≥ BP, then I decide to stay. However, if most of my neighbours belong to BP and AP < BP, then I will relocate so that AP ≥ BP.\n",

    "N individuals indexed by i have a riot threshold, T(i) ∈ (0, 1, …, N), i.e T(i) is contained in the set of all possible, real number thresholds including 0; T(i) ∈ {ℝ+0}. Initially, any individual with a riot threshold of zero, T(i)=0, joins the riot. R(t) equals the number of people rioting at time t. Individual i participates at time t if T(i) < R(t-1).\n",
    "This model reveals the importance of the entire distribution of thresholds rather than just the mean. It also shows the difficulty of predicting social movements and which ones will be successful.\n",
    "An application of this is a group of 5 people deciding whether to wear a mask. If 0 people are wearing it and everyone has a threshold of 1 or more, nothing happens and nobody wears a mask. However, if the threshold order is 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, everyone will end up wearing a mask because the person at the start takes the initiative to wear it.\n"

Also, the model assumes that the average recovery time of an infected individual would be 14 days after they contract the virus. The model also assumes that each agent (node) in the network has 20 connections (degrees). Since these interactions may be as simple as walking past somebody on the street, the chance of an infected individual transmitting the disease is 0.014, or a 1.4% chance. This configuration is maintained throughout the following scenarios, with the only difference being the implementation of lockdowns of varying durations at different moments of the 100 day period. Taking the estimated fatality rate as 2.78%, we can assume that in this scenario that after the 100 days, that 2,678 of the 96,340 agents who contracted the virus would have died. Hence, with no lockdown, it can be assumed that 2,678 of every 100,000 people would die from the virus after 100 days of its existence in society.\n"

However, after the 30 days was completed, the reopening of society led to a severe surge of cases. Ultimately, by the 100th day, 10,249 agents were still infected with the virus, which is a significant increase from the first scenario with no lockdown, which had 0 infected agents by the end of the 100 day period. Also, out of the 85,353 agents, using the estimated fatality rate, it can be assumed that 2,372 individuals would have died from the virus, with the potential to increase with the currently infected agents. Hence, whilst this lockdown has slightly reduced the amount of deaths after the 100 day period, it has prolonged the existence of the virus in society, perhaps proving more detrimental in the long run.\n"

Unlike the previous scenario, the lockdown's effect is continued even after its completion on day 80, with minimal new cases arising after the lockdown ends. Whilst there are still 38 infected agents at the 100th day, the amount of agents who were never infected at any stage of the 100 day period is significantly larger than the prior scenarios.

Due to the severe nature of this preventative measure, the number of agents who never contracted the virus is extremely high at 96,633. Hence, out of the 3,367 closed cases, using the 2.78% fatality rate, we can estimate that there were 93 deaths in this scenario. Whilst this scenario would hypothetically be the most effective measure in terms of reducing the amount of infected agents, it can be perceived as unreasonable. This is due to the fact that reducing 90% of interactions for 85 days may have a detrimental influence on the mental wellbeing of the individuals in society. Hence, whilst the model is successful in displaying the statistical information regarding the infection of the agents in this scenario, it does not account for the wellbeing of the agents, as the 85 day lockdown may be perceived as irrational and improbable.\n"

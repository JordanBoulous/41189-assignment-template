    "This report will be focused on investigating the Covid-19 pandemic, government lockdown measures and society’s subsequent response. Covid-19 is an extremely infectious disease, transmitted through droplets of coughs, sneezes or exhales generated by an exposed person. Since the discovery of the new strain of Coronavirus, it has infected over 31.4 million people worldwide and taken the lives of over 966 thousand people. Australia has over 27 thousand confirmed cases with 850 fatalities (ABS, 2020). Although Australia has seen somewhat subsided Coronavirus cases in comparison to the world, government intervention has been swift and stringent. March 23rd, a landmark date for unprecedented government intervention with the Morrison administration announcing a ban on all non-essential services (M. Grattan, 2020) Society was brought to a halt, businesses were forced to shut and citizens were encouraged to adhere to stay-at-home orders (M. Grattan, 2020). Businesses that were deemed ‘essential’ also bore the brunt of the virus as most citizens were too scared to venture outside their homes. As businesses suspended trading many found themselves without a job, the unemployment rate rising to 6.8%, compared to 5.3% last year (ABS, 2020). With so many of the population out of work, there has also been a reduction in consumer spending, reduced by 20 per cent compared to the pre-pandemic norm (ABS, 2020). \n",
    "\n",
    "During the introduction of the government’s lockdown measures, citizens were mostly obedient, following stay-at-home orders which kept Coronavirus daily cases below 100 (ABS, 2020). However, Victorians have been subject to longer, more stringent lockdown measures as a result of a spike in Coronavirus cases. As seen on the 30th of July, Victoria recorded 723 new cases, the largest spike in Australia (ABS, 2020). Victorians have been subject to 2 months of Stage 4 Lockdown. have started to question the government’s lockdown measures (VIC GOV, 2020). Residents are citing the economic damage and the seeming eternal extensions of lockdown measures as reasons for their protests and riots (M. Paul, E. Clure, 2020). Over 300 Victorians have been caught protesting on September 5th, in a bid to end their Stage 4 lockdown (M. Paul, E. Clure, 2020). It is evident a small portion of society is dissatisfied with government intervention in regards to Covid 19, with residents complaining about the length and the strict enforcement of lockdown measures. \n",
    "Finally, this report aims to outline the eventual distribution of vaccines. A Covid-19 vaccine is hoped to prevent the virus from infecting the immune system. Vaccines are rumoured to be available to Australians within the next year, with the Morrison government securing over 84 million doses (S. Morrison, 2020). However, a study by Iposos surveyed over 20,000 adults to test their willingness to take a vaccine. In Australia, it was found that 1 in 10 adults would choose not to get vaccinated and only a 59% acceptance rate worldwide (Iposos, 2020). Iposos cites fear of side effects (56%) and doubt of effectiveness (29%) as reasons for declining the vaccine. \n",

If an individual experiences any of these symptoms, they are advised to get tested and contact the ‘Coronavirus Helpline’ which provides 24/7 support. It is important to isolate after getting tested. The demographics most at risk according to the page are travellers who have recently been overseas, those who have been in contact with someone with COVID-19, people in correctional facilities and people in group residential settings. If an individual has been overseas, they must isolate for 14 days and testing is important. Those most at risk of serious illness include older people and people with compromised immune systems, disabilities or chronic conditions.

    "Models are a way to simulate a population’s behavior. By understanding models, they can be used to assist with predictions, designs and actions (UML, 2013). Government leaders all over the world are utilizing hundreds of models in an effort to understand and inhibit the transmission of the Coronavirus (ABC, 2020). Although the specific relationship between Covid cases, riots and lockdown measures have not yet been thoroughly investigated, both government agencies and private businesses have made extensive records of Covid 19 cases. Currently, the Australian Government is using Compartmental SEIR models led by the Doherty Institute as a basis for important decisions (J. Janson, 2020). The Compartmental SEIR model uses compartments as a means to simplify the mathematical modelling of infectious diseases. SEIR refers to the different states the population can exist in; susceptible, exposed, infectious and recovered. As the compartmental model is represented by an exponential decay, meaning there is an asymptote at zero infected individuals (J. Janson, 2020). \n",

    "In an effort to prohibit the transmission of the Coronavirus, governments all over the world have issued varying levels of lockdown and stay-home measures. However, by enforcing these orders and saving lives, private businesses are facing hardships as customers are scarce and money is tight. As stated by PWC’s report “We estimate that over a year , a coronavirus pandemic could reduce Australia’s GDP by $34.2 billion”. PWC have used the Global Trade Analysis model (GTAM) which is “a multi-region global, multisector, computable general equilibrium model”. A similar approach was adopted by the Commonwealth Treasury during the SARS outbreak of 2002-03. The GTAM is a mathematical model that uses a “back casting exercise”, which analyses data from previous years or instances in order to model its current task. The GTAM uses a plethora of data in an attempt to cover as many aspects of the economy as possible. \n",

SEIR models currently are overly pessimistic, such that they depict the worse effects that COVID 19 can have on individuals (Sun, 2020). By expressing these worse case scenarios depicts an inaccurate depiction of COVID 19 as currently not everyone is facing the worse off effects with many of them experiencing small to mild effects. Another issue that occurs from SEIR models is exponential decay occurs within these models. This negatively portrays the actual number of COVID 19 cases suggesting that COVID cases will never reach 0 cases. In reality this is incorrect because once a vaccine is developed there will be no COVID 19 cases, which is uncorrelated to the SEIR models exponential decay function. \n",

    "Agent based models attempt to simulate the real world in a 1:1 ratio. This is done by simulating the actions and interactions of autonomous agents that can be individuals or collectives, while assessing and analysing their effects on the system as a whole. This behaviour is based on their relations with the other agents. \n",
    "Individual agents are characterised as a rational thinker, meaning that they behave as such to optimise their goals using heuristics. One way to interpret this is ecological rationality. This could involve an individual looking over a fence and copying their neighbour if they are doing a task better, or keep doing the same thing while occasionally trying something new. The basic idea is to imitate, exploit and explore. The decisions an individual makes propagates through a complex network of interactions and the surrounding environment.\n",

It explains how an individual will segregate based on the behaviour of the surrounding agents or neighbours.\n",
    "Imagine a NxN checkerboard. Some people (represented by squares) receive a higher salary AP and the others have a lower salary BP where P represents an individual. If I belong to the former category AP and most of my neighbours also belong to AP and hence AP ≥ BP, then I decide to stay. However, if most of my neighbours belong to BP and AP < BP, then I will relocate so that AP ≥ BP.\n",

    "N individuals indexed by i have a riot threshold, T(i) ∈ (0, 1, …, N), i.e T(i) is contained in the set of all possible, real number thresholds including 0; T(i) ∈ {ℝ+0}. Initially, any individual with a riot threshold of zero, T(i)=0, joins the riot. R(t) equals the number of people rioting at time t. Individual i participates at time t if T(i) < R(t-1).\n",
    "This model reveals the importance of the entire distribution of thresholds rather than just the mean. It also shows the difficulty of predicting social movements and which ones will be successful.\n",
    "An application of this is a group of 5 people deciding whether to wear a mask. If 0 people are wearing it and everyone has a threshold of 1 or more, nothing happens and nobody wears a mask. However, if the threshold order is 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, everyone will end up wearing a mask because the person at the start takes the initiative to wear it.\n"

    "In order to use the riot model effectively, we must estimate the thresholds of individuals in a society. Assuming that the ‘riot’ action is accepting a vaccination as a preventative measure to Covid-19, then there are different hypothetical scenarios which could occur:\n",
    "- If a sample of 100 individuals is taken and the lowest threshold of an individual T(i) = 1, then nobody will take the vaccine. \n",
    "- In order to correct this, there must be an individual with T(i) = 0, which is likely for desperate individuals or individuals with a strong incentive to take the vaccine. Hence, for each individual with T(i) = 0, the number of people rioting R(t) will increase by 1. \n",
    "- Then, for each other individual, the following formula, T(i) >= R(t) is applied. If true, then they will accept the vaccine and R(t) will increase. \n",
    "- Eventually, either everyone will accept the vaccine, or those with extremely high thresholds will never accept the vaccine.\n",

    "Hence, in order to apply this model, a sample of the population would need to provide their own personal threshold which would result in them accepting the vaccine as a preventative measure to the Covid-19 pandemic."

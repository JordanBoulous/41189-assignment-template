    "This report will be focused on investigating the Covid-19 pandemic, government lockdown measures and society’s subsequent response. Covid-19 is an extremely infectious disease, transmitted through droplets of coughs, sneezes or exhales generated by an exposed person. Since the discovery of the new strain of Coronavirus, it has infected over 31.4 million people worldwide and taken the lives of over 966 thousand people. Australia has over 27 thousand confirmed cases with 850 fatalities (ABS, 2020). Although Australia has seen somewhat subsided Coronavirus cases in comparison to the world, government intervention has been swift and stringent. March 23rd, a landmark date for unprecedented government intervention with the Morrison administration announcing a ban on all non-essential services (M. Grattan, 2020) Society was brought to a halt, businesses were forced to shut and citizens were encouraged to adhere to stay-at-home orders (M. Grattan, 2020). Businesses that were deemed ‘essential’ also bore the brunt of the virus as most citizens were too scared to venture outside their homes. As businesses suspended trading many found themselves without a job, the unemployment rate rising to 6.8%, compared to 5.3% last year (ABS, 2020). With so many of the population out of work, there has also been a reduction in consumer spending, reduced by 20 per cent compared to the pre-pandemic norm (ABS, 2020). \n",
    "\n",
    "During the introduction of the government’s lockdown measures, citizens were mostly obedient, following stay-at-home orders which kept Coronavirus daily cases below 100 (ABS, 2020). However, Victorians have been subject to longer, more stringent lockdown measures as a result of a spike in Coronavirus cases. As seen on the 30th of July, Victoria recorded 723 new cases, the largest spike in Australia (ABS, 2020). Victorians have been subject to 2 months of Stage 4 Lockdown. have started to question the government’s lockdown measures (VIC GOV, 2020). Residents are citing the economic damage and the seeming eternal extensions of lockdown measures as reasons for their protests and riots (M. Paul, E. Clure, 2020). Over 300 Victorians have been caught protesting on September 5th, in a bid to end their Stage 4 lockdown (M. Paul, E. Clure, 2020). It is evident a small portion of society is dissatisfied with government intervention in regards to Covid 19, with residents complaining about the length and the strict enforcement of lockdown measures. \n",
    "Finally, this report aims to outline the eventual distribution of vaccines. A Covid-19 vaccine is hoped to prevent the virus from infecting the immune system. Vaccines are rumoured to be available to Australians within the next year, with the Morrison government securing over 84 million doses (S. Morrison, 2020). However, a study by Iposos surveyed over 20,000 adults to test their willingness to take a vaccine. In Australia, it was found that 1 in 10 adults would choose not to get vaccinated and only a 59% acceptance rate worldwide (Iposos, 2020). Iposos cites fear of side effects (56%) and doubt of effectiveness (29%) as reasons for declining the vaccine. \n",

However, it was also found in stool samples, the gastrointestinal tract, saliva and urine. It also states that the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) virion is spherical with a diameter of 80-120nm, contains a non-segmented, positive-sense RNA genome and contains numerous glycoproteins. Diagnosis and testing involves a swab and is often performed when a patient experiences fever, a sore throat, dry cough, dyspnea or they were in contact with a recent confirmed case.\n",

It lists the same symptoms as the article (fever, cough, shortness of breath, sore throat) as well as uncommon symptoms. If an individual experiences any of these symptoms, they are advised to get tested and contact the ‘Coronavirus Helpline’ which provides 24/7 support. It is important to isolate after getting tested. The demographics most at risk according to the page are travellers who have recently been overseas, those who have been in contact with someone with COVID-19, people in correctional facilities and people in group residential settings. If an individual has been overseas, they must isolate for 14 days and testing is important. Those most at risk of serious illness include older people and people with compromised immune systems, disabilities or chronic conditions.

    "Models are a way to simulate a population’s behavior. By understanding models, they can be used to assist with predictions, designs and actions (UML, 2013). Government leaders all over the world are utilizing hundreds of models in an effort to understand and inhibit the transmission of the Coronavirus (ABC, 2020). Although the specific relationship between Covid cases, riots and lockdown measures have not yet been thoroughly investigated, both government agencies and private businesses have made extensive records of Covid 19 cases. Currently, the Australian Government is using Compartmental SEIR models led by the Doherty Institute as a basis for important decisions (J. Janson, 2020). The Compartmental SEIR model uses compartments as a means to simplify the mathematical modelling of infectious diseases. SEIR refers to the different states the population can exist in; susceptible, exposed, infectious and recovered. As the compartmental model is represented by an exponential decay, meaning there is an asymptote at zero infected individuals (J. Janson, 2020). \n",

    "In an effort to prohibit the transmission of the Coronavirus, governments all over the world have issued varying levels of lockdown and stay-home measures. However, by enforcing these orders and saving lives, private businesses are facing hardships as customers are scarce and money is tight. As stated by PWC’s report “We estimate that over a year , a coronavirus pandemic could reduce Australia’s GDP by $34.2 billion”. PWC have used the Global Trade Analysis model (GTAM) which is “a multi-region global, multisector, computable general equilibrium model”. A similar approach was adopted by the Commonwealth Treasury during the SARS outbreak of 2002-03. The GTAM is a mathematical model that uses a “back casting exercise”, which analyses data from previous years or instances in order to model its current task. The GTAM uses a plethora of data in an attempt to cover as many aspects of the economy as possible. \n",

    "Current SEIR models are significantly preventing COVID 19 from being fully addressed and solved. SEIR models currently are overly pessimistic, such that they depict the worse effects that COVID 19 can have on individuals (Sun, 2020). By expressing these worse case scenarios depicts an inaccurate depiction of COVID 19 as currently not everyone is facing the worse off effects with many of them experiencing small to mild effects. Another issue that occurs from SEIR models is exponential decay occurs within these models. This negatively portrays the actual number of COVID 19 cases suggesting that COVID cases will never reach 0 cases. In reality this is incorrect because once a vaccine is developed there will be no COVID 19 cases, which is uncorrelated to the SEIR models exponential decay function. \n",

Big Data Models have the main purpose of suggesting how many cases of COVID 19 per day or all together in a certain country or population. This doesn’t solve the issue of COVID 19 as it only shows the number of cases and does not depict ways in which the pandemic can be dealt with. Also Big Data Models also show an inaccurate number of COVID 19 cases as in many developing countries, several cases go unreported (Lau, 2020). This doesn’t provide a true addressment of the actual number of COVID 19 cases in these countries. This also has a strong negative effect on the analysis of this data as the data analysis will be inaccurate in terms of the characteristics of COVID 19 cases in different countries (Lau, 2020). \n",

    "Agent based models attempt to simulate the real world in a 1:1 ratio. This is done by simulating the actions and interactions of autonomous agents that can be individuals or collectives, while assessing and analysing their effects on the system as a whole. This behaviour is based on their relations with the other agents. \n",
    "Individual agents are characterised as a rational thinker, meaning that they behave as such to optimise their goals using heuristics. One way to interpret this is ecological rationality. This could involve an individual looking over a fence and copying their neighbour if they are doing a task better, or keep doing the same thing while occasionally trying something new. The basic idea is to imitate, exploit and explore. The decisions an individual makes propagates through a complex network of interactions and the surrounding environment.\n",

    "Schelling’s segregation model is an agent based model created by Thomas Schelling. Schelling wanted a reason as to why people of different races and incomes tend to segregate in most parts of the developed world. It explains how an individual will segregate based on the behaviour of the surrounding agents or neighbours.\n",
    "Imagine a NxN checkerboard. Some people (represented by squares) receive a higher salary AP and the others have a lower salary BP where P represents an individual. If I belong to the former category AP and most of my neighbours also belong to AP and hence AP ≥ BP, then I decide to stay. However, if most of my neighbours belong to BP and AP < BP, then I will relocate so that AP ≥ BP.\n",

    "Granovetter’s riot model is utilised in order to measure an individual’s willingness to make a decision based on the decisions of those around them (the rioters). Each person has a threshold and if the number of rioters exceeds that threshold, the person joins in.\n",
    "N individuals indexed by i have a riot threshold, T(i) ∈ (0, 1, …, N), i.e T(i) is contained in the set of all possible, real number thresholds including 0; T(i) ∈ {ℝ+0}. Initially, any individual with a riot threshold of zero, T(i)=0, joins the riot. R(t) equals the number of people rioting at time t. Individual i participates at time t if T(i) < R(t-1).\n",
    "This model reveals the importance of the entire distribution of thresholds rather than just the mean. It also shows the difficulty of predicting social movements and which ones will be successful.\n",
    "An application of this is a group of 5 people deciding whether to wear a mask. If 0 people are wearing it and everyone has a threshold of 1 or more, nothing happens and nobody wears a mask. However, if the threshold order is 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, everyone will end up wearing a mask because the person at the start takes the initiative to wear it.\n"

The model also assumes that each agent (node) in the network has 20 connections (degrees). Since these interactions may be as simple as walking past somebody on the street, the chance of an infected individual transmitting the disease is 0.014, or a 1.4% chance. This configuration is maintained throughout the following scenarios, with the only difference being the implementation of lockdowns of varying durations at different moments of the 100 day period. Taking the estimated fatality rate as 2.78%, we can assume that in this scenario that after the 100 days, that 2,678 of the 96,340 agents who contracted the virus would have died.

However, after the 30 days was completed, the reopening of society led to a severe surge of cases. Ultimately, by the 100th day, 10,249 agents were still infected with the virus, which is a significant increase from the first scenario with no lockdown, which had 0 infected agents by the end of the 100 day period. Also, out of the 85,353 agents, using the estimated fatality rate, it can be assumed that 2,372 individuals would have died from the virus, with the potential to increase with the currently infected agents.

Whilst there are still 38 infected agents at the 100th day, the amount of agents who were never infected at any stage of the 100 day period is significantly larger than the prior scenarios.

Hence, out of the 3,367 closed cases, using the 2.78% fatality rate, we can estimate that there were 93 deaths in this scenario. Whilst this scenario would hypothetically be the most effective measure in terms of reducing the amount of infected agents, it can be perceived as unreasonable. This is due to the fact that reducing 90% of interactions for 85 days may have a detrimental influence on the mental wellbeing of the individuals in society.

One way of improving these agent based models’ performance speed is by adapting a time extension to it. This will improve the solution as it will portray to the scientist’s the solution at a quicker rate. Another limitation of Agent based models is it is reliant that all the individuals will reduce their interactions, which means the solution will not work with everyone as not every individual will follow lockdown rules.

One of the current issues with Segregation models is that running the model with the same preference configuration can potentially lead to vastly different outputs, hence these models can be slightly unreliable. One of the ways of resolving this issue is by conducting several tests before the Segregation model is completed and synthesising the test results to get a more accurate final result. Another thing that can be done to Segregation Models is changing the required similarity rates of these models, as Segregation Models fail to account for people changing their behaviour over time. Segregation Models showing people’s changing behaviours will delineate a more accurate solution in order to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Another disadvantage is that Segregation Models vary from city-to-city. People in one city may segregate more or less when taking into account multiple factors such as wealth, race, if people who have COVID-19 are nearby and proximity of houses."

    "With respect to many model thinking, Granovetter’s Riot Model can be used to see if people will accept a new vaccine as a preventative measure for COVID-19. The main disadvantage with Granovetter’s Riot Model is that a small sample of the public must be willing to test out the vaccine as soon as it is released. If everyone has a threshold greater or equal than 1, no one will try the vaccine. By getting a willing volunteer to test, we can apply the Riot Model successfully and demonstrate how quickly the vaccine will be distributed globally. In a way similar to Schelling’s Segregation Model, Granovetter’s Riot Model does not account for people changing their behaviour over time. A person’s threshold may go up suddenly for a number of reasons, such as a recently found side effect with a vaccine or a family member advises them to not get it. This is important as it means the person may never take the vaccine. Accounting for this changing behaviour and increasing people’s confidence may make Riot Models more suitable, but this is difficult to do so this model is not suitable for this scenario."

I was also designated as the group member to implement all of our work onto Jupyter Notebook and push the commits to our GitHub repository.  When reflecting on the work that I contributed towards the project, I am able to acknowledge the difficulties that I experienced during the duration of the task, especially with the platforms that I had previously been entirely unfamiliar with that I had to use in order to complete the report. However, I am also proud of my overall contribution due to the hours that I put into researching and completing my sections to what I believe to be at a high quality.\n",

The fact that multiple models can be applied to one problem to accentuate the multiple facets of the issue, resulting in more varied and successful solutions is a concept that will prove to be vital in essentially all aspects of business. Another major benefit of this project is getting used to GitHub, not only as a tool to create repositories, but also to find existing working models which I can adapt to fit practically any desired task. \n",
    "\n",
    "iv) Upon reflecting on the group’s approach to the report, it is made evident that we were forced to deal with multiple issues, mostly arising as a result of our inexperience with Python, GitHub and Jupyter Notebook. The first major issue came with installing the necessary extensions to use Jupyter Notebook in addition to GitHub. Initially, Alex attempted to do this, although after running into a few difficulties with the process, I attempted to do so and after a bit of research on how to do so, I was able to successfully install the required extensions. It was from here that I was able to learn how to push changes to the GitHub repository which allowed us to complete the report in the manner that was required. Another significant problem arose when completing the implementation section of the report, which we found difficult primarily due to the fact that none of us has had any experience with Python. However, with the help of Juan, we were able to understand what exactly was required of us, and how we were simply meant to find existing code for working models and adapt that code to fit our problem, as opposed to writing the models from scratch. This made the section a lot easier to follow and we were able to find appropriate code for our selected problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "v) When deciding on the models to use for a selected problem, you must consider the involved agents before you can select a model. For example, if the model relates to understanding a person’s, or group of people’s, behavioural characteristics, than it would be necessary to implement a model which explains why people make certain decisions, such as a signalling model or a networking model to understand how information is exchanged between the agents and influences their decision making abilities. Similarly, if the focus of the problem is related to statistics and the analysis of data, then distribution models would be considered. This is made evident through our selection of models since we established that the preventative measures to the Covid-19 pandemic have different effects on different people, and in order to measure their satisfaction or tolerance of a certain solution to the virus, we implemented the segregation and riot models, to understand how they would respond to the measures. Also, the agent based model was implemented in order to measure the success of a lockdown, which is suitable since it is a 1-1 model of reality, which makes it appropriate for this specific problem.\n"

My group and I asked Juan for help in understanding Python code and he responded by attaching articles of Python code and its link to different models such as Agent based models and Schelling’s Segregation Model. This was very beneficial for me as it gave me ideas of code to use when explaining the different models. Another way in which I overcame the challenge of Python Code is by doing extensive research and watching YouTube videos on Python code explaining the fundamentals of this code.\n",
    "Another challenge that was faced in this project was communication was difficult originally because due to the COVID 19 protocols our subject was not open on Campus. This problem was resolved because after I joined Group 6, Jordan Boulous created a Facebook Messenger group chat, which included myself, Cameron Solomon and Raymond Lam. This was beneficial as we now inform each other of any difficulties that we are facing or any questions about the assignment and someone else in the group will answer the question. This has helped our group submit an adequate assignment as well as making sure that the assignment was completed on time. \n",

    "v) If I was faced with a real world problem and needed to do some modelling I would determine the situation and the characteristics comprising the real world problem.\n",
    "The most important thing is gaining as much data as possible about the specific real world problem. Once the data is gained it needs to be understood whether the data can be broken down efficiently into graphs. If this can be expressed well in graphical representation, then Network models should be preferred over other models.\n",
    "Another characteristic that I will use in order to determine which modelling approach to use is how many different groups there are. For example if the real world problem was a virus, one group would be the virus with the other being the virus. If there were only two groups, then I would use the Colonel Blotto Game, whereas if there were multiple groups then I would use other models such as agent based models. \n"

    "i) My contribution to this assignment consists of parts, 1.1, 2.3 and 5.2. I believe my contributions to this assignment have reflected my full potential however, I feel I could have finished my contributions earlier and relieved stress from my other group members. I struggled to juggle my assignments and exams this semester and it is something I wish to work on throughout my time at university. \n",
    "\n",
    "ii) I believe my other group members have done an amazing job completing their respective sections of the task and have done it in a timely manner which allowed us, as a group, to look through and edit our assignment before it was due. However, with the pandemic and our current learning situations it made it somewhat difficult to schedule meetings with each other and our tutor. Our group was able to get together to solve a problem, although we had our own designated parts for the assignment, I found that we were able to solve issues an individual was having together.  I believe this expedited our  Overall I believe our group has completed this assignment to the best of our ability and I am happy with the final report we have produced. \n",
    "\n",
    "iii) This project has taught me to work together to solve problems, although I’ve completed group projects before it was usually extremely segregated and each person was focused on their own problems. However, with this task my teammates were extremely collaborative and worked through issues together. Also, the idea of many-model thinking, was solidified through this assignment. Although we had learnt about this concept in workshops, we were not able to experience it and fully immerse ourselves in this way of thinking. This project has allowed us to become many-model thinkers, which I believe will make us smarter citizens of the world. Finally, the use of GitHub and JupyterLab, at the start of this assignment our group was quite intimidated by these new platforms however as we explored its features and inner workings we have all become familiar with these popular platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "iv) Our group had many issues with Python and the implementation of our models into Jupyterlab. We worked together to solve small issues however with larder issues we had to reach out to Juan. As we were all new to Python and JupyterLab, we were unable to diagnose our code or read errors. Although with our research and the help of Juan we were able to work through these issues and come out with functional models. We also had issues communicating and setting meetings in the early-stages of this project. However, Jordan was able to overcome these issues by creating a group chat. This group chat allowed our group to stay in constant communication and update each other about our assignment. This chat also allowed us to set and attend meetings. Although our group had trouble setting an appropriate time to meet, we were able to overcome this by going through each day until we found a time in which we were all available. Finally, this chat allowed us to stay accountable and reach out to each other to ensure the task would be completed in a timely manner, allowing for final edits and formats. \n",
    "\n",
    "v) When selecting a model, there must be a succinct understanding of the goal, inputs and expected outputs. The aim of the model, depending on the situation different models are to be utilized for different purposes. It would be impossible to predict housing prices with Schelling’s Segregation Model, rather Markov models would be more appropriate. Similarly, the types of inputs and expected outputs of the model need to be considered. For numerical data types, distribution models would better suit the situation as they usually output graphs which may be closer to the desired output type. As shown in this report, measuring the rate of infection and overall satisfaction of government intervention regarding Covid-19, a combination of riot, agent-based and Schelling Segregation model are used. Finally, one must realise that a combination of models is most effective, in contrast to a single model. \n"

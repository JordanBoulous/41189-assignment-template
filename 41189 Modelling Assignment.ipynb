Agent-based models can be used to predict outcomes for an array of different scenarios in the Covid-19 predicament, providing reliable calculated estimates of the deaths, recoveries and infections for different preventative measures. With the application of this model, we are able to track the virus’ impact on individual agents, with constant updates occurring in order to provide a reliable model with relevant data based to assist with the tracking of infection and recovery in the Covid-19 global crisis. This can accentuate the success or failure of different preventative measures since the simulations can be compared to determine the most and least effective methods to diminish the impact of the virus.\n"

Hence, we are able to witness the effects of emotional segregation in different communities according to different ‘similarity rates’, which are the percentage of people surrounding individuals that they wish to be vaccinated in order to be satisfied. This is useful in regards to the possible solutions to the Covid-19 pandemic since it can be used to predict the contentment of individuals in a society after a vaccine is released, providing insight into the amount of vaccinations that need to be produced in order to create a general sense of comfort.\n"

This is necessary information as it allows us to be able to recognise the number of willing participants based on the different thresholds in a society. Hence, this data can be utilised to predict the amount of vaccines that must be produced, and can also be used to predict the amount of people with specific thresholds required in order to flatten the curve representing the growth of Covid-19.  \n"

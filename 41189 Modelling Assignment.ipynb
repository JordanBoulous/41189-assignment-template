The contents of the text are complete, clearly documented and use a variety of different resources to ensure accuracy. It also used very recent information that was available and despite being released in July, the article is still relevant in September. The authors study pharmacy, biomedical science and life science - so there may be some vested interest and bias due to the authors studying similar courses.\n",
    "The article states that person-to-person transmission is likely for COVID-19 and is primarily spread through direct contact and droplets from a cough or sneeze. However, it was also found in stool samples, the gastrointestinal tract, saliva and urine. It also states that the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) virion is spherical with a diameter of 80-120nm, contains a non-segmented, positive-sense RNA genome and contains numerous glycoproteins. Diagnosis and testing involves a swab and is often performed when a patient experiences fever, a sore throat, dry cough, dyspnea or they were in contact with a recent confirmed case.\n",
    "Preventative measures include wearing face masks and other personal protective equipment (gloves), good hand hygiene, social distancing, isolation and quarantine. Rapid diagnosis, vaccines and therapeutics are critical in managing the COVID-19 pandemic.\n"

As it is written by the government, the information is complete, accurate and comes from a reliable source. The page and the pages for the individual states are constantly being updated as the situation progresses.\n",
    "The page also examines the symptoms of COVID-19 as the previous article did, although this is in a more concise manner. It explains how the seriousness of COVID-19 can range from a mild illness to pneumonia and how some recover quicker than others. It lists the same symptoms as the article (fever, cough, shortness of breath, sore throat) as well as uncommon symptoms. If an individual experiences any of these symptoms, they are advised to get tested and contact the ‘Coronavirus Helpline’ which provides 24/7 support. It is important to isolate after getting tested. The demographics most at risk according to the page are travellers who have recently been overseas, those who have been in contact with someone with COVID-19, people in correctional facilities and people in group residential settings. If an individual has been overseas, they must isolate for 14 days and testing is important. Those most at risk of serious illness include older people and people with compromised immune systems, disabilities or chronic conditions. The page also covers the same preventative measures as the article as well as avoiding public gatherings, and give links to explain how each measure is effective. Many places of academia and businesses apply these preventative measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19. \n",
    "Various other government pages are available for each state and territory which discuss the different preventative measures and management of COVID-19.

    "Agent based models attempt to simulate the real world in a 1:1 ratio. This is done by simulating the actions and interactions of autonomous agents that can be individuals or collectives, while assessing and analysing their effects on the system as a whole. This behaviour is based on their relations with the other agents. \n",
    "Individual agents are characterised as a rational thinker, meaning that they behave as such to optimise their goals using heuristics. One way to interpret this is ecological rationality. This could involve an individual looking over a fence and copying their neighbour if they are doing a task better, or keep doing the same thing while occasionally trying something new. The basic idea is to imitate, exploit and explore. The decisions an individual makes propagates through a complex network of interactions and the surrounding environment.\n",

    "#### Schelling’s Segregation Model:\n",
    "Schelling’s segregation model is an agent based model created by Thomas Schelling. Schelling wanted a reason as to why people of different races and incomes tend to segregate in most parts of the developed world. It explains how an individual will segregate based on the behaviour of the surrounding agents or neighbours.\n",
    "Imagine a NxN checkerboard. Some people (represented by squares) receive a higher salary AP and the others have a lower salary BP where P represents an individual. If I belong to the former category AP and most of my neighbours also belong to AP and hence AP ≥ BP, then I decide to stay. However, if most of my neighbours belong to BP and AP < BP, then I will relocate so that AP ≥ BP.\n",
    "Everyone uses this heuristic where someone decides to move or stay depending on the ratio of people who are alike. It should be noted that a micro-motive does not equal macro-behaviour in Schelling’s segregation model.\n",

    "#### Riot Models (Granovetter Threshold Theory):\n",
    "Granovetter’s riot model is utilised in order to measure an individual’s willingness to make a decision based on the decisions of those around them (the rioters). Each person has a threshold and if the number of rioters exceeds that threshold, the person joins in.\n",
    "N individuals indexed by i have a riot threshold, T(i) ∈ (0, 1, …, N), i.e T(i) is contained in the set of all possible, real number thresholds including 0; T(i) ∈ {ℝ+0}. Initially, any individual with a riot threshold of zero, T(i)=0, joins the riot. R(t) equals the number of people rioting at time t. Individual i participates at time t if T(i) < R(t-1).\n",
    "This model reveals the importance of the entire distribution of thresholds rather than just the mean. It also shows the difficulty of predicting social movements and which ones will be successful.\n",
    "An application of this is a group of 5 people deciding whether to wear a mask. If 0 people are wearing it and everyone has a threshold of 1 or more, nothing happens and nobody wears a mask. However, if the threshold order is 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, everyone will end up wearing a mask because the person at the start takes the initiative to wear it.\n"

Agent-based models can be used to predict outcomes for an array of different scenarios in the Covid-19 predicament, providing reliable calculated estimates of the deaths, recoveries and infections for different preventative measures. With the application of this model, we are able to track the virus’ impact on individual agents, with constant updates occurring in order to provide a reliable model with relevant data based to assist with the tracking of infection and recovery in the Covid-19 global crisis. This can accentuate the success or failure of different preventative measures since the simulations can be compared to determine the most and least effective methods to diminish the impact of the virus.\n"

Hence, we are able to witness the effects of emotional segregation in different communities according to different ‘similarity rates’, which are the percentage of people surrounding individuals that they wish to be vaccinated in order to be satisfied. This is useful in regards to the possible solutions to the Covid-19 pandemic since it can be used to predict the contentment of individuals in a society after a vaccine is released, providing insight into the amount of vaccinations that need to be produced in order to create a general sense of comfort.\n"

This is necessary information as it allows us to be able to recognise the number of willing participants based on the different thresholds in a society. Hence, this data can be utilised to predict the amount of vaccines that must be produced, and can also be used to predict the amount of people with specific thresholds required in order to flatten the curve representing the growth of Covid-19.  \n"
